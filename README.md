## About the Project

Bingiene is an AI-powered, sensor-integrated waste management solution that automatically detects, classifies, and segregates waste into four categories: dry, wet, metal, and plastic. This innovative technology is designed to improve recycling rates, reduce landfill usage, and optimize waste collection processes.

## Key Features

### Auto Waste Detection
Advanced sensors detect waste type as soon as it's placed near the bin opening, making waste disposal effortless for users.

### ML-Based Classification
Machine learning algorithms identify and sort waste into dry, wet, metal, and plastic categories with high accuracy.

### LED Feedback System
Visual feedback helps users understand waste classification with intuitive color-coded signals.

### Real-Time Fill Level Alerts
Collection teams receive notifications when bins need emptying, optimizing collection routes and reducing operational costs.
